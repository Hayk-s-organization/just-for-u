# Product Details App

This is a simple React application that fetches and displays product details from an API.

## Getting Started

The idea of this simple project is to help us consume the API we just created on the BE part of the exercise.

To get started with the project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

To start the application locally, use the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

The app will be served at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

### Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```shell
npm test
```

The tests ensure that the app is able to fetch data from the API and display the expected output.
